        Hello, I'm James Harris, the developer of this website.
        <br />
        <br />
        This was a group project where we were required to create a website that
        would allow a user to post details for a caravan they wanted to rent out
        to another person.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am studying full-time in university to achieve my goal of becoming a
        Software Engineer and I work part-time in a pub.
        <br />
        <br />
        This project has taught me a lot about HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, SQL
        and much more.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am looking forward to creating more websites in the future as I very
        much enjoyed the process and the final result.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thanks for checking the website out
